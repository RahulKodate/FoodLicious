Purpose of the project::
The purpose of FoodLicious (a food blogging and ordering website ) is to provide a platform for food bloggers to share their delicious and unique recipes, cooking techniques, and food experiences with a wider audience. FoodLicious may aim to create a community of food enthusiasts who can share their passion for food and engage with each other through comments, forums, and other interactive features. 

Additionally, FoodLicious may offer an online ordering system for users to order food from their favorite local restaurants and food vendors. This feature could make it easier for users to find and order their favorite dishes from a range of restaurants and food vendors, all in one convenient platform. FoodLicious may also offer special deals and discounts to users who order food through their platform. 

Overall, the purpose of FoodLicious is to bring together food bloggers and enthusiasts, and make it easier for them to connect and enjoy delicious food from  restaurants and food vendors.


======================== Phase 1 development:: ====================== 

Pages:
1. Home page
2. Our Team page
3. Office Page

////// Bootstrap Components used in project::

1. NAVBAR: Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that.
Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin. We have applied some inline CSS align with the external CSS
to customize based on our requirements.

2. BUTTON: Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose,
with a few extras thrown in for more control. We have used the button in hero section for slider.

3. CAROUSEL: The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript.
It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.
We have used carousel at multiple places in sliders and testiminials.

4. CARD: Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization.
Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components.
We have used the card section in the team page and list of best restaurants.

5. COLLAPSE: Collapse is the hidded content which is opens after the clicking on button.
We have used the collapse in the learn more button in list of best restaurants.

6. FORM: Bootstrap’s form controls expand on our Rebooted form styles with classes. Use these classes to opt into their customized displays for a more consistent rendering across browsers and devices. We have used the form components in the search restaurants section and subscribe newsletter form.

7. CHECKBOX: Checkbox is used for selecting the option

8. PROGRESS BAR: Progress components are built with two HTML elements, some CSS to set the width, and a few attributes. We don’t use the HTML5 <progress> element, ensuring you can stack progress bars, animate them, and place text labels over them. We have used the progressbar in this analytics showing most liked dishes by customers.

9. DATA LIST: Datalists allow you to create a group of <option>s that can be accessed (and autocompleted) from within an <input>

10. DROPDOWN: Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more.
They’re made interactive with the included Bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin.
They’re toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.
We have used dropdown in the from for selecting the pre defined elements from the from.

11. BADGE: Documentation and examples for badges, our small count and labeling component used in Nav Bar notification
